        A sofa creates the initial impression of your home. It is the first furnishing accessory that your guests see when they enter your house. It is also one of the first investments made by new homeowners. The sofa even acts as a bed, or a dining chair when your new house is unfurnished for the first few days. Before making a hasty purchase, you must know which size of sofa set you should be looking for.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        All of IKEA’s sofa designs look incredible in your living room. But, what’s most important is to know the dimensions of this room and get a proper understanding of the interiors. By calculating the floor area available at your disposal, you can find a couch that keeps your house airy.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">How to Choose the Right Sofa for Your Needs</h2>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Size and Space:</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When selecting a sofa, it's crucial to consider the size and layout of the room where it will be placed. Measure the available space to ensure the sofa fits comfortably without overcrowding the room. Consider the room's dimensions and the placement of other furniture items, like coffee tables and end tables, to maintain a harmonious balance.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Style and Design:</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The style and sofa design you choose should harmonize with the existing decor and aesthetics of your home. Whether you favour a modern sofa design or a more classic and traditional feel, choosing a sofa that complements your overall interior design is essential.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Material:</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The choice of upholstery material has a significant impact on the sofa's comfort, appearance, and maintenance. Fabric sofas are versatile, with various patterns and textures, but may require more maintenance, including regular cleaning.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Colour:</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The colour of your sofa should complement the room's colour scheme and ambience. Neutral colours like beige, grey, and white are versatile and can easily adapt to different design styles. Bolder colours or patterns can add personality and a focal point to your living space.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Comfort:</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A sofa's primary function is to provide comfort, so it's vital to assess its comfort level. When trying out sofas, pay attention to the seat depth, the cushioning's firmness or softness, and the backrest's support.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Frame and Construction:</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The sofa's frame and construction are the foundation of its durability and longevity. Look for a solid, well-constructed frame made from hardwood or high-quality metal.
      </p>
